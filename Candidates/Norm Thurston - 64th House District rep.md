# Norm Thurston - 64th House District Rep

## 2018-03-21

### Research
#### Document suggests state Rep. Norm Thurston was punished for a pattern of misconduct
>A Utah House document indicates that Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, was punished this month for a “pattern” of misconduct, not just a one-time problem.

>House Speaker Greg Hughes last week removed Thurston as vice chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, and he also was taken off of the House Health and Human Services Committee.

>Tribune columnist Robert Gehrke earlier reported that Thurston was punished for an inappropriate comment to a woman working at the Capitol, and had previously been admonished for his behavior toward women. [1]

### Caucus Meeting
Norm had envelopes waiting for elected delegates. The former precinct chair (Diane Christensen) did not seem very sold on letting him take control.
