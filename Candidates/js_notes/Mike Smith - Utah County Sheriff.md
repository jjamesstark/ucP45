>Smith said that he has loved his time working with the Pleasant Grove Police Department, his fellow employees and the community, but he would also love the opportunity to serve the entire county community and employees of the Sheriff’s Office. [1]
>
>Because he has experiences outside of the Sheriff’s Office, he will be able to bring a fresh perspective to the position, which will be healthy for the team and office, he said.

Adopted use of CVSA
>There is no replacement for good old-fashioned police work, but using tools to enhance that work is important,” said Pleasant Grove Police Chief Mike Smith. “Tools such as the CVSA allow us to more efficiently and effectively focus our investigative direction. In the short time we have had this tool, we have been able to solve crimes that otherwise had limited investigative leads. [2]

Citizen participation in Use of force reviews
>There are several reasons we decided to involve citizens in our use of force reviews, but one of the most important reasons is transparency. We want our community to know we take these incidents seriously,” said Chief Mike Smith. “If there are areas that require attention or training, we want to identify those areas. It has been a very positive experience involving citizens. We are able to hear a different perspective and understand how our community views our enforcement actions.

>Employed the Lethality Assessment Program
Pleasant Grove’s officers are in training this week to begin using the program. In the first 10 months of this year, the department had already responded to about 300 domestic violence calls. Because of the seriousness and frequency of this problem, Chief Mike Smith decided to begin using the Lethality Assessment Program.
>
>“During my career, I have had the unfortunate experience, as most officers do, of seeing victims of domestic violence return to their abusers only to be abused again, and many times abused more severely each time,” Smith said. “Any program that can help identify high-risk victims, link them with services and establish a critical safety plan is a step in the right direction.” [4]
