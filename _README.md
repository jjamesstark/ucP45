# Utah County 45th Precinct Election Project

## Mission

1. Inform voters with locally and democratically sourced information about the elections, offices, and candidates relevant to our community.
2. Provide transparent access to delegates and candidates in order to amplify the voices of our own community.
3. Organize ourselves locally in order to improve community self reliance and foster community cohesion.

By creating and contributing to this project we intend enable delegates and citizens of the 45th precinct to find and publish information relevant to our community this election year. However, more important than party victories is assuring that our neighborhood is adequately organized and represented.

## How to use this website
We hope that this website provides valuable information about political candidates as well as the ideas and concerns of our community members. We plan to achieve this with community sourced profiles on the candidates and a transparent and accessible means to leverage the interactions our precinct delegates are having with candidates.

### Candidate profiles
We want to provide profiles for all candidates (federal, state, county, and city) that will be on the ballots for our precinct this fall. Again, this information is community sourced with full transparency about who is sourcing the information by using github to manage all contributions, including edits.
